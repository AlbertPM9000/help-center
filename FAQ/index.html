                <p><strong>Fix De# or Fi#! It is impossible to use them or have proper performance in them.</strong></p>
                <p>We are already trying our best to improve our current services however we cannot guarantee to provide good enough hosting for free, if you want to get better performance or reliability, please switch to our exclusive locations aka US.</p>
                <p><strong>Will we be able to host source games servers?</strong></p>
                <p>No, source games consume a lot of CPU power. Do not expect us to add options like Garry’s Mod.</p>
                <p><strong>I joined a server from #join-for-resources and didn’t get anything</strong></p>
                <p>You’ll need to log out of the client and log back in. If your resources are not there yet, the server you joined might not be configured yet.</p>
                <p><strong>My server keeps crashing.</strong></p>
                <p><a href="https://help.falixnodes.net/server-wont-start-or-crashes-when-i-play/">Read here</a></p>
                <p><strong>If I close the tab, is the server still running?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, closing your web browser won’t affect the server in any way. The server is running on our side.</p>
                <p><strong>Who is the owner of FalixNodes?</strong></p>
                <p>The owner of FalixNodes is Lamaker</p>
                <p><strong>Is there a plugin limit?</strong></p>
                <p>No, there is not. You can add as many plugins as you want, but we do recommend at least under 20 – 50 plugins so you don’t overload the server.</p>
                <p><strong>What is a domain? Is it useful for Minecraft servers?</strong></p>
                <p>A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for application-specific naming and addressing purposes.</p>
                <p>Some examples of famous domains names “google.com” and “hypixel.net”. You can buy one and use it as a way to join your server. Instead of typing a numerical IP, you and your users can type your domain name. It is considered easy and professional.</p>
                <p><strong>How do I increase my RAM/Disk/CPU/Server limit?</strong></p>
                <p>You can increase your RAM/Disk/CPU/Server limit by donating a minimum of 5. Be sure to ask what resources you can receive depending on the amount of money you donate in a ticket before donating.</p>
                <p>Or, you can earn FalixCoins by visiting https://client.falixnodes.net/coins &amp; using one of the earning methods. You can visit https://client.falixnodes.net/store to purchase with your Falixcoins.</p>
                <p><strong>Is FalixNodes free and is there a trial?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, FalixNodes is free to use. No, there is no trial, it’s free forever.</p>
                <p><strong>Does the server turn off automatically?</strong></p>
                <p>Your server will not turn off automatically, unless the node it is on overloads for whatever reason. Also make sure you do log into your client and panel at least every 14 days, because of our Inactivity System, which you read about in our&nbsp;<a href="https://falixnodes.net/terms-and-conditions.php">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>My server is taking forever to install.</strong></p>
                <p>This does happen sometimes when creating a server. You need to delete the server and try again. You may have to try up to 3 – 10 times.</p>
                <p><strong>Can I earn FalixCoins on mobile?</strong></p>
                <p>Yes, please use desktop mode in your mobile web browser. It has been confirmed to work on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.</p>
