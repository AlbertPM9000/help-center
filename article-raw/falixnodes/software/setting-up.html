<h2>Installing Process</h2>
<p>FalixNodes Software is built on Electron, meaning it's cross-platform and supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and ChromeOS. The installation is easy to follow and you should of the software installed within at least 2 minutes or less(depending on your internet speed).</p>

<h3>Windows 10</h3>
<p>You can install the software easily in the Microsoft Store on Windows 10. Just search "FalixNodes" and the software should show up. Select it and click install.</p>
<p>or you can click here:</p>

<!-- <p><a href="#">Why Microsoft Store?</a></p> Will attached to FAQ later -->

<h3>macOS</h3>
<p>Due to restriction with Apple, the software is not available in the App Store, but we have provided a DMG option instead.</p>
<p>If you're using macOS, click the download button on the software website. A DMG file will be provided. Open the DMG file and simply drag the FalixNodes app into the Applications folder.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>On Linux, there are many ways to install software like apt, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)" target="_blank">deb</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager" target="_blank">rpm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux#Pacman" target="_blank">pacman</a>, etc. We've chosen the Snapstore for easy distrubing and to make it easy to add auto updating.</p>
<p>Use the following commands to install Snap on your distro(Snap comes pre-installed on Pop OS, Fedora, and Ubuntu):</p>
<p>Also note, if you're using Fedora, replace `apt` with `dnf` instead.
<pre>
sudo apt install snapd
snap install falixnodes
</pre>

<h2>Updating</h2>

<h3>Windows 10</h3>
<p>Since FalixNodes Software is available in the Microsoft Store, you can easily manage updates.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/get-updates-for-apps-and-games-in-microsoft-store-a1fe19c0-532d-ec47-7035-d1c5a1dd464f">Learn how to updates app on Windows 10</a></p>
<h3>macOS</h3>
<p>Auto updating is still not available for macOS users, you'll need to manually install new updates. When a new update is available, just re-download FalixNodes and install the newer version.</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Since FalixNodes Software is available in the Snapstore, you can easily update. For some distros, the update might be available through the app store included with your distro, if this isn't the case, try the following command:</p>
<pre>
sudo snap refresh falixnodes
</pre>

<h2>Uninstalling Process</h2>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Stuck on advertisement in Game Panel or Client Panel</h3>
<p>If you've misclicked on an advertisement in the Client Panel, there is no way to back out. Controls currently don't work properly in the Client tab, you'll need to reload the software. You can reload the software by pressing Ctrl R or clicking the reload button found at the bottom of the Settings tab.</p>
<p>If you've misclicked on an advertisement in the Game Panel, click the back button. If for whatever reason this isn't working, click the kill button(x button) and load the panel again.</p>
<h3>Software is not opening</h3>
<p>For Linux users, assuming you installed from Snap, Snap apps can take a moment to open as they're being sandboxed. The first boot will take longer. If you're not using Snap and choice to build the software instead, there may of been an error. Please read and troubleshoot any errors that show up on in your terminal.</p>
<p>For Windows users, please check your task manager and see if FalixNodes Software is running. Since it's built on Electron, you may see a few instances of it running. You can kill the process and try again, if it's not working on the second try, you can try re-installing the software.</p>
<h3>FalixNodes Software caused BSOD on Windows</h3>
<p>This issue has been reported a few times, but has not ben seen by Korbs(developer). If for whatever reason this does happen, please let us know.</p>
<h3>The sidebar is completely transparent</h3>
<p>You can adjust the transpancy of the sidebar in your Apperances setting, select at least 60% - 100% for the opacity. If the setting isn't working for whatever reason, please report an issue</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting - Building</h2>
<p>These are issues you may get while building the software from GitHub</p>
<h3>Glasstron not found or not defined</h3>
<p>Glasstron is widely used in the software, you'll need to make sure you've installed it's dependency. To install Glasstron, use the following command:</p>
<pre>
npm install glasstron
</pre>
<h3>Electron and/or BrowserView not defined</h3>
<p>This will occur if you've choosen Electron v10 and up. Please only use Electron v9.0.0 - v9.4.3. Run the following commands:</p>
<pre>
npm uninstall electron
npm install electron@9.4.3
</pre>
<p>This issue is the reason why we use Electron v9.</p>
<h3>Electron Builder has errors while installing</h3>
<p>We're not sure what's causing the issue either, please try installing an older version of Electron Builder instead. In our case, we just use:</p>
<pre>
npm install electron-builder@20.0.0
</pre>
Electron Builder v20 still has all the features we need to build FalixNodes Software, with no issues.
<h3>Appx file won't open</h3>
<p>If you've built a APPX file on Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, this file can't be used. APPX file is built for Windows 10 only.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.falixnodes.net/article/falixnodes/software/faq-for-developers/">What's an APPX file?</a></p>
<h3>Appx file won't let me install on Windows 10</h3>
<p>We recommend that you actually EXE format instead of APPX. Please change the target under Windows to "nsis". NSIS will provide a EXE setup file.</p>
<p>If you want to use Appx, keep reading:</p>
<p>Assuming you've tried to build a Appx file with Electron Builder, we didn't use this. We use Electron Windows Store dependency instead, we use the following command to build:</p>
<pre>
electron-windows-store --input-directory C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Documents\Desktop-App\dist\win-unpacked  --output-directory C:\FalixNodes-Software\ --package-version 2.3.31.1 --package-name falixnodes --publisher-display-name "Korbs Studio" --identity-name "32203KorbsStudio.FalixNodesSoftware" --package-display-name "FalixNodes Software" --assets C:\Users\YOURUSERNAMEHERE\Documents\assets
</pre>
<p>You'll need to setup and change some of these paths and download assests for the Windows 10 version. Also please do use Electron Builder to unpack the app(usually creates a win-unpacked folder)</p>
