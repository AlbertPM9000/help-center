<p><strong>When logging in with Discord, a bunch of servers show up on my server list, why is this?</strong></p>
<p>This occurs when using logging in with offers, by joining these extra servers, you'll recieve more resources. If you did not choose the offers option when logging in via Discord, then there must of been a mistake on our end.</p>

<p><strong>What're the specs?</strong></p>
<p>Our specs are available to see on our Discod server on the [machine specs](https://discord.com/channels/710503370187735160/804747442997559336/804749877652881479) channel.</p>

<p><strong> How do I fix the error "We're having some trouble connecting to your server, please wait..."</strong></p>
<p>This error means that the wings are not working for your node. The wings are the connection between the panel and the node. If the wings are offline your server will be not offline, only the panel will not work properly. There is no way to fix this, the wings automatically restart every 20 minutes. If you wait a few minutes it should be fixed.</p>

<p><strong>How do I upload my world?</strong></p>
<p>It is not possible to drag and drop a folder. If you need to upload a folder from your pc to the server, then use SFTP.</p>

<p><strong>Error Event [xxx.xxx.xxx]: another power action is currently being processed for this server, please try again later</strong></p>
<p>This error you get when too many people try to start their server. The connection cannot handle so many requests so it gives an error. If the wings are overloaded your server will be not offline, only the panel will not work properly. Most time this error will fix when you try it later again, do not spam click any start/stop button.</p>
