            "><p>The Help Desk was put together by <a href="https://KorbsStudio.com" target="_blank">Korbs Studio</a> for FalixNodes, to make a place to find more answers and show tutorials on hosting a server in FalixNodes. As of right now, the Help Desk is beta, but what does that mean exactly? It means that the website might be broken for browsers like Safari and Firefox, and that mobile support still being worked on. Currently the website is mostly tested on chromium browsers in Linux/Windows and also tested in Safari on an iPhone 8. The category for Minecraft is also still expanding, as there is so much more to add. Along with more categories, since FalixNodes doesn't just offer Minecraft hosting. More categories do need to be created for other option like Discord bots, Redis, Teamspeak3, Terraria, and much more later on.</p>
                <p>There is also plans to add troubleshooting support for <a href="https://software.falixnodes.xyz">FalixNodes Software</a>, a quick access application.</p>
                <p>Update(September 11th, 2020):</p>
                <p>The Teamspeak3 section is now being worked on.</p>
