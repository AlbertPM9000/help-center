                <p>With DiscordSRV, you are able to give players the ability to chat in-game to chat with players on your Discord server as well as having people on the Discord server be able to chat with people on the server- this is useful for the situation of someone not being at their computer and being able to talk in-game.</p>
                <p><strong>Setting it Up</strong></p>
                <p><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/" target="_blank">Download DiscordSRV</a> from Spigot and add the .jar file to your plugins folder. Then simply reboot your server so that all configuration files are generated. We need to now create and add a Discord Bot to your Discord serve, don't worry you don't have to host the bot, the plugin allows your Minecraft server to do all of the hosting.</p>
                <p>To create a bot in Discord, go to your <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications" target="_blank">Discord Portal</a> and create a new Application, name it and click create. On the left sidebar, go to bot, click Add Bot, and click Yes I Do. We can create an invite link for the bot by taking it's ID, found in General Information, and using it in this URL, this URL is what you will use to invite your bot:</p>
                <p id="command">https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=PUTYOURBOTIDHERE&permissions=134217750&scope=bot</p>
                <p>Once we've added the bot, it should appear in your Discord server now.</p>
                <p>Back on the Discord Portal, go back to Bot, and copy the bot's token. Edit the configuration file found in DiscordSRV folder in plugins, at the top of the configuration file, replace "BOTTOKEN" with your bot's token. Now we need to tell what channel the bot should chat in, you can do this by right clicking on a channel in Discord, then copying the channel ID. Replacing "000000000" next to channels in the configuration file with the channel ID you copied. Now the bot will know what channel to chat in.</p>
                <p>Now that all of that is done. Save your configuration file and boot your server, once the server is booted, the bot should say that the server has started.</p>
