                <p>There are multiple causes to why your server won't start or why it's crashing. Commonly, this could be caused by poorly configured plugins, making the plugin behave poorly preventing the server from either starting up or crashing. It is also possible that your server may not have enough memory to handle all of the plugins you have installed, causing a crash, so upgrade memory or use plugins that uses less resources. You could also remove one plugin at a time until you find out which one is broken. If you're unable to find the problem, feel free to create a ticket on our Discord.</p>
